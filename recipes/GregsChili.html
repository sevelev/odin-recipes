        <h1>Greg's Chili</h1>
        <img src="../images/chili.webp" alt="chili">
        <p>This once secret family recipe traces its roots all the way back to
            1857.  Wallace G. Wilmhoff of Saltwine, Kentucky, was one of the first
            owner/operators of a Watson Dry Cleaning Press.  Its popularity began as
            more of a spectacle people traveled to see in action, the steam billowing
            out, the new smells of modern technology and of course, his eldest daughter
            Elizabeth Sue.
        </p>
        <p>Well, if you are wondering what all this has to do with chili, here you go:
            Elizabeth Sue Wilmhoff came to visit her father with a bean soup recipe she 
            was working on for him to offer his honest opinion.  She came when he was eating
            lunch - a hamburger with onions, cheddar cheese and ketchup.  
        </p>
        <p>If you don't know already, ol' Wallace lost his left arm in a printing
            press accident in his 20s.  When Elizabeth Sue brought him the soup, he tried to 
            pinch his hamburger between his shoulder and neck while tasting a spoonful of chili. 
            The chili was hot.  Too hot.  He burned his mouth and immediately jerked and he watched
            in slow motion as his hamburger arced through the air toward the open dry cleaning press. 
            He did try to catch it before it landed and ruined his beautiful new press, but all he
            succeeded in doing was smacking the bowl of bean stew out of poor Elizabeth Sue's hand,
            dumping the soup onto his beloved dry cleaning press.
        </p>
        <p>The stew and hamburger became a stew covered burger that was simmering on the press.
            Wallace, not one to disobey the 5 second rule reached down, grabbed the stew burger,
            picked it up and took a bite.  "Oh, my!" he exclaimed, "This is delicious!"  "Try adding
            a hamburger to your stew recipe."
        </p>
        <p>Indeed, Elizabeth Sue did just that.  With her father helping her ever step of the way with 
            this recipe, it became the family's cherished(and award winning) chili recipe.
